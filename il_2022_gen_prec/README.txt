Precinct shapefile sourced from U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program final release via the [Voting Election Science Team's Illinois 2020 precinct file](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/K7760H&version=43.0). Precinct boundaries were replaced with boundaries obtained either through direct communication, publicly available files or geo-referenced precinct maps in the following counties: Adams, Bond, Boone, Christian, Clinton, Cook, Effingham, Jasper, Jersey, Jo Daviess, Kane, Kankakee, Kendall, Knox, Lake, Lawrence, Lee, Macon, Macoupin, Madison, Marion, McDonough, McHenry, Monroe, Morgan, Moultrie, Ogle, Peoria, Randolph, Shelby, Stephenson, Tazewell, Vermilion, Will, Winnebago, Woodford

County precinct maps available via the [Illinois State Board of Elections](https://www.elections.il.gov/precinctmaps/).

All precinct boundaries were checked against the precinct assignments in an individual-level Illinois voter file pulled from L2 in April, 2023.

Characters 2 and 3 are the year of the election.*
Characters 4-6 represent the office type (see list below).
Character 7 represents the party of the candidate.

## Notes
Non-precinct level votes, marked "Federal" were allocated from the county-level to the precinct-level using each precinct's share of precinct-level votes in that contest.

Election result totals were compared against official county-level totals. There are minor differences present between the two, with the largest difference in one county for one race totaling 12 votes.

Certain precincts are split by congressional or legislative districts and have votes for more than one district. These precincts are split by the district geographies. In certain cases, votes appear in precincts for districts that do not intersect with the precinct itself. In the split precinct files, these votes are "lost" and not included in the resulting file. For the SLDL file, 49 votes were lost, for the SLDU file, 44 votes were lost and for the congressional file, 29 votes were lost. The geographies of these precincts with lost votes were double-checked to ensure it was not a processing error on our end.
